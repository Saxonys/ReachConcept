# ReachConcept
A c++ reach concept for those who are learning the basics of memory hacking. Stripped from the Nexus/Itami v3 Source Code.

**Can I use this for my ghost clients?**

This can be used for your ghost clients as long as it is not used for any paid products.

You may pull request improved code if you would like. This is just an example, so it is not the best reach source code out there.
